        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p><br>These are flyers I designed to advertise for Student Government elections in 2014. My friend, Juliette, and I decided to run for the two Freshman Senator positions and we needed something cool to stand-out from our competitors. While other candidates were chalking-up sidewalks, we went with a more personal approach... personally delivering our campaign materials door-to-door. These are the designs we used. They were printed on the thickest paper I could get from the bookstore, and we had a couple hundred to distribute. Considering many people share a dorm with one or two other people, our dorm-approach guaranteed each flyer would get atleast 1.5x the attention of meeting people one-on-one. <br><br>I'm not a big fan of stark #000000 black, so I chose to go with a lighter grey. Considering the roughness of the main title font, I wanted to soften the whole look a little as well. The rough-header was to really stand-out from typical marketing materials on campus while replicating a stamped or inked look. My choice was definitely too sharp of a contrast for the softer Quicksand body text we went with, but YikYak was huge on campus at the time, and I knew Quicksand (their font at the time) would be amiable to the freshman class.

        <p>They say do things that don't scale... so I left a block of space above the mission statement so when we go door-to-door to campaign one of us could write a personal message while the other delivers a pitch to vote for us. This turned out to be much harder than planned because our pitch was relatively short and it was hard to find a hard surface to write-on (as well as come-up with a unique message right on the spot). The left-align looked a little odd, but once-again, the logic was to stand-out. It would have looked much better with a more traditional print left-align. Only having been in school for about a week, we couldn't fill the copy with much meaningful text. I had originally planned to put our signatures at the bottom of the body text, but the open box for personalization ended up being the place for that.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p><br>The print-quality turned out really well, especially for the body-text on a dark ink background. Good contrast and visibility. The paper felt sturdy and professional. We chose to write messages in bold Sharpie colors to contrast the neutral grey and white flyer. If I were to use a similar template, I would select a better font-pairing between the header and body. The sharp divider lines also contrasted a little too starkly with Quicksand, so I would either round-out the corners or select a sharper body font. While we wanted to personalize the flyers, it became extremely tedious to write messages on every flyer. It would have been a better idea to push the welcome message to the top of the information-side of the flyer and add printed signatures (or authentic inked-in signatures) to the bottom of the copy. I would've like to photoshop our faces in a cooler-style next to the names, but the reading experience worked well enough so that the reader could apply the names to the faces. I tried to mirror the names along that center line, but it looked a little awkward to have them face eachother when you can easily read them stacked. The '14 could have been better-oriented to read along the orientation of the rest of the text as well.
